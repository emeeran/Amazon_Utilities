<li>Product looks pretty solid. Have been using since a week, it is comfortable and stable. Go for it.</li>
<li>I am giving this review after using it for a month. I found this very easy to handle, sturdy and comfortable. This item doesn’t take much space. The double cushion is really good, best part is it’s neither hard nor soft it’s just perfect but don’t know for how long the cushion will stay like this. Overall I found it as best buy though price pov it is on a higher end.</li>
<li>Its a very comfortable bed with solid mattress I personally like hard beds so this bed stands in middle ground the quality is absolutely fantastic</li>

    I have sciatica and spondylosis and this bed is truly very comfortable even for those who are suffering from such medical conditions. Definately worth the price and useful.</li>
<li>Very comfortable</li>
<li>Writing this review after using it for closer to 1 year. Overall fully satisfied with the quality and comfort of this.Pros:- Sturdy and good framework- Comfortable cushion for a good sleep- No shaking or loosen parts- Worth the moneyCons:- Head side rails/curved frame structure height/gap should be more so that one can keep the hands over the head comfortably. Right now due to less height/gap it obstructs the sleeping posture- Taller people may find it bit difficult (> 5.8 ft)</li>
<li>Product is exactly as shown in the picture . Light weight and durable.</li>
<li>Nice to use</li>
<li>Product is good but expensive compared to similar products. High Star rating should be mostly due to persistent follow-ups by seller on WhatsApp. Not sure how they get our mobile number and contacting us directly.. I have been purchasing in Amazon for an era and i have seen only two seller DM like this.. Anyways i am happy with the product eventhough costly so giving 5 star.</li>
<li>Good</li>
