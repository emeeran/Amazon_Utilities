### Review 1
- This product is working fine. 650watt power at 2800 rpm have enough power to daily home uses.In package you get 4 drill bit, which is not enough. You have to buy extra for wood, and metal. (Buy from local store. Not online)That 4 bit which is comes with in box is only used for concrete or brick drill.I decided to buy bosch gsb 600 drill machine which is costly more than this But i take a risk for this company and it is worth it.Drill machine is good. Work properly.There is spark in machine but it is come due to carbon. After sometime when carbon worn out than spark will gone.Quality of material is better than what i expected. Some users have issue with missing part in box. But i didn't find this problem in my box all parts are available.You have to register warranty online website or you can whatsapp them at given number which is comes in box. This review based on 1 week of uses. But i have feelings that this machine save money and give you same performance as bosch machine. Don't go for 450 watt or 500 watt machine. Buy 650 watt of any company.I also noticed ibell customer support is also good so i think after service will be also good that is my assumption.Still if you hesitate then go for bosch. But i think this is indian company so no problem for made in india. I also love the variables speed of this machine if you press slowly speed will increase slowly.Easy to used. But little bit heavy.There is some drill machine which is cost 700₹ to 900₹ only for drill hole. That is aslo good option for save money. Go with any company. That machine don't comes speed variable. Once you press button you get full speed.I also go for offline shop but price is higher side in offline shop. So go for online don't waste time. Bosch machine are selling higher price at offline shop. So buy from online store Amazon or Flipkart.One for think ibell drll machine fit finishing is good in real life then what you see 8m photo. Compare to bosch the bosch is good quality. 19, / 20 ka farak hai.In photo machine is dirty because i take photo after i used.

### Review 6
- Recently, I purchased this machine. After going through other brands, capacity, features etc, I zeroed upon this machine, and it proved to be right choice. This machine has hammering feature for drilling holes in brick walls or concrete slabs.We can use up to 13 MM Drill bits in this machine which is essential for fixing anchor fasteners, or fan hooks in the walls or concrete slabs.For using 13MM Bit, more powerful machine is needed and this machine is 650W unlike others 400Ws.There is clock wise and anti clockwise rotation option in this machine. It lets us fixing screws or removing.Although, this machine is a bit heavy, it is inevitable when it is 650W power tool and also it indicates good quality of armature and coil inside. Overall, the machine seems to be good and affordable price. Very useful for home.
